Collision handling is done when more than one value can be stored in the same hashmap block.

It can be done by 2 ways:

1. Open hashing (Separate chaining) :
    - In this a linked list is stored in a block of hashmap, when an element has to enter in the same block, then they are 
     placed in that linked list.

2. Closed hashing :
    - In this method, if the desired block is filled, then we find an alternate block for the data by the formula.
      hi(a) = hf(a) + f(i) 

      hi : function for finding the block where the data has to be placed
      hf : hashing function
      f  : function for finding alternate
