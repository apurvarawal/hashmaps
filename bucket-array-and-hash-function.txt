Hash function consists of :
1. Hash code 
2. Compress function

HASH CODE:
----------

for INT:
- it can be simply the number itself.

for string:
- it is for instance:
  - "abc" = (ASCII val of 'a' * p^3) + (ASCII val of 'b' * p^2) + (ASCII val of 'c' * p^1), where p is a prime number.

COMPRESS FUNCTION:
------------------

- val obtained from hash code % size of array
